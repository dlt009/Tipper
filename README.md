Submitted by: David Tan

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Added a bill splitting feature so users can see the final amount they need to pay after the total is divided amongst the party

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I faced while building the app was both dealing with auto layout constraints as well as trying to debug an error where one of my outlets no longer existed, but was still being accessed by the code.
